        <P>you fall, you rise you make mistakes, you live, you lear. you are human, not perfect<br>
        you have been hurt, but your alive. Think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive<br>
    to breathe, to think, to enjoy, and to chase the things you love. Sometimes<br>
        there is sadness in our journey, but there is also lots of beauty. We must keep putting one<br>
    foot in front of the other even when we hurt, for we will never know <br> what is waiting for us just 
    around the bend.</P>
    <p>When you depend on people to build you up they will have the same<br>
    power to break you down. You dont need their validation to know your worth</p>
