        <p>i am 20 years old girl who has insipered myself to reach my destiny. I never let my dream goes down<br>
        always i believed on what my effort tells if i fight much i get mush and if i fight less i get<br>
    small. No one has born reach in this world but we found our richness once we started fighting.<br>
everyones effort tells the success smell, i believe in someones effort and not depending on <br>on someones support
</p><p>Once someone is matured he or she learn or plan how the future will be, but most of them fails due <br>
to some suqumstance appearred around them or others gives up, specially girls conclude to be <br>married and
they cannot add more on what they suppose to do. sometimes they fails because of lack of knowledge <br> not every
every girls is educated on how to maintain her life with family perspective so they ended married.</p>
